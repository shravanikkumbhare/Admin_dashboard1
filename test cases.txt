Here are some relevant test cases to ensure the sanctity of the code for the Admin Dashboard project:

### Frontend Test Cases:

1. **UI Rendering Test**:
   - Ensure all UI components render correctly on different screen sizes and browsers.
   - Test responsiveness of the dashboard on various devices.

2. **User Authentication Test**:
   - Verify that users can log in with valid credentials.
   - Ensure unauthorized users cannot access the admin dashboard.

3. **Data Visualization Test**:
   - Check that charts/graphs display accurate data based on the provided dataset.
   - Verify that the data is updated in real-time when changes occur.

4. **User Management Test**:
   - Test adding a new user and verify the user is added to the system.
   - Test editing user details and ensure changes are reflected in the user profile.
   - Test deleting a user and verify the user is removed from the system.

### Backend Test Cases:

1. **API Endpoint Testing**:
   - Test each API endpoint with valid inputs and ensure expected responses are returned.
   - Test each API endpoint with invalid inputs and ensure appropriate error messages are returned.

2. **Data Integrity Test**:
   - Verify that data stored in the database matches the expected format and schema.
   - Test CRUD operations on data and ensure data integrity is maintained.

3. **Authentication and Authorization Test**:
   - Test authentication middleware to ensure only authenticated users can access protected routes.
   - Test authorization middleware to ensure users can only perform actions they are authorized to do.

4. **Error Handling Test**:
   - Test error handling mechanisms for various scenarios such as server errors, database errors, and validation errors.
   - Verify that error messages are informative and user-friendly.

### Integration Test Cases:

1. **End-to-End Workflow Test**:
   - Simulate a complete workflow of a user interacting with the admin dashboard, from login to performing various actions.
   - Verify that the system behaves as expected at each step of the workflow.

2. **API Integration Test**:
   - Test integration between frontend components and backend APIs to ensure seamless communication.
   - Verify that data sent from the frontend is correctly processed by the backend and vice versa.

3. **Database Integration Test**:
   - Test integration between the application and the database to ensure proper data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.

4. **Performance Test**:
   - Measure the response time of API endpoints and database queries under different loads to ensure scalability and performance.

By executing these test cases, we can ensure that the Admin Dashboard application functions correctly, maintains data integrity, and provides a reliable user experience.
